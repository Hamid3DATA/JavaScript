In the [scripts](https://github.com/Hamid3DATA/JavaScript/tree/main/BlackJack/scripts) folder, you fill find two scripts, "app.js" and "app2.js".
<br />
app.js is a prototype and therefore is incomplete, while app2.js is thw "final" version (i think). Which means that you do not need app.js file at all.
