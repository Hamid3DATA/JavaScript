In the [scripts](https://github.com/Hamid3DATA/JavaScript/tree/main/BlackJack/scripts) folder, you fill find two .js files, "app.js" and "app2.js".
<br />

app.js is a prototype and therefore is incomplete, while app2.js is the "final" version (i think).
<br />

Which means that you don't need app.js file at all.
